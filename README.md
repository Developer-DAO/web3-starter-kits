## Why Create Web3 Starter Kits Repo?

When building new projects, having an up-to-date, well maintained starter kit can be the difference between shipping some of value or getting stuck in boilerplate hell 😭

Our goal with the Web3 Starter Kits Repo, is to provide Members and non-members alike, with starter-kits they can rely on for common use cases when building in Web3.
